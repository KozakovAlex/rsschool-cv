## About me.
_I work in finance, but I would like to change my job. I can't say that my salary is small, but I don't see my future life on my current work-place. So I decided to learn webdev year ago. I began learning HTML&CSS from youtube courses, after that I continued to leaarn HTML, CSS, JS in HTML-academy (training tasks). I've finished some landing-sites,  you can see it on my repository:

https://github.com/KozakovAlex/Wathes-sales
When I have free time, I try reading articles on smashingmagazine and I like watching Vladilen Minin.
My book for learning JS is https://learn.javascript.ru/. And I train my skills in JS on codewars (my current level's 6kyu).
Now I'm working on a task 'web-calculator'. When I finish it I'll push it on my git (https://github.com/KozakovAlex).
That's all)
Sorry for my English (I tried to write alone, without google)._

## English-level.
A2 (finished Streamline-courses and I have sertificate).
